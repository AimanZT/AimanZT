- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aiman

-A little bit about me:

As a teenager at school, I was one of the kid at school that other kids and teachers went to when they had problems or difficulties with their devices ranging from a laptop to a projector. I was the go-to guy with any technical issues that arose.
Not much has changed since then. When it comes to technical problems, I'm also the first one to call, especially in my club. Discovering and fixing problems has always been fun and exciting to me. This led me into pursuing my studies in IT related field and this is one of the best decisions that I have made after high school.
Currently I'm undergoing Deriv's BeSquare Programme Trainee.

Thank you for reading. Feel free to connect and chat with me for any further inquires.
